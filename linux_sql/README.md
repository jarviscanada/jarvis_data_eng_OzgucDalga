#Introduction 
   In this Linux_SQl project some data/informations will be stored and they will have generated the reports for future. The data which is called hardware specifications will be recorded.Secondly, the data which is called node/resources/server(CPU/Memory) will be monitored. Later on, collected data will have been stored in RDBMS. In order to that, three different server/nodes will be set up, each node is going to be linked through internal connection to switch. Bash agent will collect server usage data and then bash gent will insert them into PSQL instance. In order to that it will have two main bash scripts host_info.sh and host_usage.sh Basic steps listed below

  - Creation of postgreSQL instance, 
  - Database Tables,
  - Collect hardware specifications for each server,
  - Monitoring node/server resources(Cpu/Memory),
  - To store the collected data on RDBMS,
  - To manage the data needs.

The technologies that will be used;
  
  - Git/Github/GitFlow,
  - Bash,
  - Docker,
  - PostgreSQL,
  - DDL (Data Definition Language),
  - DML (Data Maniplulation Language).
