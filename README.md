# Ozguc Dalga . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated with a degree in Computer Software & Database Management from Lambton College on the Toronto campus. My status is work permit holder until 2026 like plenty of developers in Canada. I am extremely curious about coding and discovering new technologies in the world of software since when I was little, in other words, I would say that it's my passion to implement new things on the consequences of learning in-depth. Plus, I am so interested big-Data. Furthermore, I am so comfortable working with math as I would say that it's my way of life.

**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OzgucDalga/tree/master/linux_sql)]:Designed Cluster Monitor project, in this project some data/information would be stored and they could have generated the reports for the future. The data which is called hardware specifications are recorded. Secondly, the data which is called node/resources/server(CPU/Memory) is monitored. Later on, collected data will have been stored in RDBMS. In order to do that, three different servers/nodes will be set up, each node is going to be linked through an internal connection to switch. Bash agent will collect server usage data and then bash gent will insert them into the PSQL instance. In order to do that, it will have two main bash scripts host_info.sh and host_usage.sh, Basic steps are listed below. The technologies that will be used; Linux/Bash, Docker, PostgreSQL.

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OzgucDalga/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: The current project is undergoing now.
  - JDBC App: Designed JDBC project, it aims to create a connection between Java program and RDBMS such as PostgreSQL database. Furthermore, to handle CRUD implementation based on this JDBC connection. Furthermore, Docker was used to keeping containerization on the project as well as Dbeaver was used to display tables in the hplussport database."
  - Grep App: Designed Grep application to learn the fundamentals of core Java. In this project, the grep app searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory and outputs matched lines to the file. Furthermore, Docker was used to create local image and container, all the things recorded was published in dockerhub. "
