# Ozguc Dalga . Jarvis Consulting

I graduated from Lambton College with a degree in Computer Software &  Database Management from the Toronto campus. I'm pretty inquisitive regarding coding and discovering new technologies in the software world. In other words, I would say that my passion is to implement new things on the consequences of learning in-depth. For instance: designing, improving documentation, and driving by collective
success. I am extremely comfortable working with math because it is my way of life.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OzgucDalga](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OzgucDalga)


**Cluster Monitor** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OzgucDalga/tree/master/linux_sql)]:Designed and developed the Cluster monitor project in Linux-OS. The application collects hardware data and monitors them using a basch Script and then the data is stored in RDBMS/SQL(POSTGRESQL). Business questions are responded to by creating SQL queries. The application is scheduled using crontab. The source code is managed by Github. The databse is provisioned with Docker. 

**Core Java Apps** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_OzgucDalga/tree/master/core_java)]:
      
  - Twitter App: The current project is undergoing now.
  - JDBC App: Designed JDBC project, it aims to create a connection between Java program and RDBMS such as PostgreSQL database. Furthermore, to handle CRUD implementation based on this JDBC connection. Furthermore, Docker was used to keeping containerization on the project as well as Dbeaver was used to display tables in the hplussport database.                                                
  - Grep App: Designed Grep application to learn the fundamentals of core Java. In this project, the grep app searches for a text pattern recursively in a given directory and outputs matched lines to the file. Furthermore, Docker was used to create local image and container, all the things recorded was published in dockerhub. 

## Highlighted Projects
**Web app for History Agenda** [[GitHub](https://github.com/ozgucdlg/mernStackHistoryAgendar)]: Designed history agenda project to complete self-learning progress using Visual studio code editor. Application hosts users's requests with dynamic-responsive pages created HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT. Later on, the application creates main SQL queries in database  and updates the database(mongoDB). Application is covered using NPM package manager and organized with MVC architecture implementing ReactJS framework. Source code is published on Github.
