summary: I graduated from Lambton College with a degree in Computer Software & Database Management, and am now a full stack developer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I work in an Agile environment. I have experience with Java, Maven, JUnit, MySQL, PostgreSQL, bash, and docker. I have used Postman for developing RESTful apps. I consider myself a positive person, a cross-functional team member, a quick learner, detail-oriented, and adaptable to changing circumstances. I always make sure that I meet deadlines. Throughout my career, I have had a strong passion for math and am interested in searching for new technologies and implementing them in-depth.
