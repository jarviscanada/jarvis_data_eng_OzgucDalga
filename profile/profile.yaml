# Preferred ender/Generate different file formats
# #Make sure you run this command prior to every profile pull request
# bash profile_app.sh
#
# #This tool will generate the following files
# ../README.md #overwrite your existing README
# profile.json #this file will be consumed by Jarvis Consultant App
# jarvis_profile_John_Smith.pdf #PDF version of ../README.md
# profile.yaml
# This is the only file you should edit. The profile_app.sh will convert/render your profile.yaml into multiple formats for different purposes.
#
# YAML (a recursive acronym for "YAML Ain't Markup Language") is a human-readable data-serialization language (similar to JSON but more human-readable). It is commonly used for configuration files and in applications where data is being stored or transmitted.
#
# YAML Syntax Guide
#
# profile_app.sh
#
#
# Usage:
#
# #download sample yaml file
# bash profile_app.sh init
#
# #Render/convert the profile.yaml
# bash profile_app.sh
# The script will execute the following components documented below.??
#
# YAML validator
# Yamale is used to validate the profile.yaml against the profile_schema.yaml.
#
# jrvs/yamale docker image is available
#
# Markdown
# render_mardown is a Python tool that renders the profile.yaml file into a markdown file. The rendered markdown file will overwrite the ../README.md which servers as the landing page for your Github.
#
# jrvs/render_profile_md docker image is available
#
# JSON
# mikefarah/yq docker image is used to convert the profile.yaml into a JSON. The JSON file will be consumed by the Jarvis consultant web app which allows Jarvis' clients to easily view all profiles.

# Build your profile Steps
#  ??Please see the BSA_profile branch for BSA specific instructions (e.g. profile.md is tailored for BSA)
#   Setup the profile tool in your Github repo by following the Quick Start
#    Edit the profile.yaml file from your favorite IDE.
#     Please read instruction/comments from the template profile.yaml carefully
#      Check your spelling and grammar through https://www.grammarly.com/ before each commit
#       Execute bash profile_app.sh (please make sure you execute this bash script before each commit)
#        Open a pull request that merges the feature branch into the master branch (yes, you can skip develop and release branches)
#         Senior developer and CSA will comment and review your PR.
#          You will need to update your profile.yaml file for each project as part of the project closing the ticket. (please make sure you execute this bash script before each commit)
#          Appendix: Project/Job Description
#          A project/job description allows hiring managers to understand the followings:
#
#          Context (e.g. web app for store owners, a mobile app for students, etc.)
#          Technical keywords, such as language, frameworks, design, tools, etc. (e.g. Java, Springboot, Microservice, REST API, Hadoop, Spark, etc.)
#          Results and achievements (e.g. performance improvement, award, product delivery, etc.)
#          Please follow the simplified SDLC pattern that covers Design/Purposes, implementation/technologies, test (manual/unit/integration), and DevOps/Deployment to describe a project. Please see the sample description below.
#
#          #Design/Purposes
#          Developed an XYZ app in [programming language] which is used for blah blah. 
#
#          #Implementaiton/technologies
#          Implemented the app with Spring Boot, JDBC, X, Y, Z, etc.  
#
#          #Test 
#          Tested the app with Junit, X, Y, etc.
#
#          #Deployment
#          Dockerized the app blah blah.
#
#          #of course, the description should be in one line.
#          For non-technical projects/jobs, you can focus on soft skills instead of technologies (e.g. agile/scrum, team collaboration, communication, problem-solving, etc.)
#
#          A project/job description shall start with an action verb
#
#          Non-technical action verbs
#          Common action verbs for developers
#          Designed
#          Implemented
#          Coded
#          Programmed
#          Developed
#          Architected
#          Utilized
#          Collaborated
#          Worked
#          Initiated and lead
#          More action verbs

summary: I graduated from Lambton College with a degree in Computer Software & Database Management, and am now a full Stack developer at Jarvis Consulting Group, where I work in an Agile environment. I have experience with Java, Maven, JUnit, MySQL, PostgreSQL, bash, and docker. I have used Postman for developing RESTful apps. I consider myself a positive person, a cross-functional team member, a quick learner, detail-oriented, and adaptable to changing circumstances. I always make sure that I meet deadlines. Throughout my career, I have had a strong passion for math and am interested in searching for new technologies and implementing them in-depth.
